<h2>Mitsubishi spare parts</h2>
<p>Other than one or two wheel bearings, most parts can be sourced from either Japanese or overseas sources. Please see our parts pages for details. Often we find very good quality used engines to be available for scrapping. Where can I dispose of the old tyre in my car? Lacking a wheel, tyre manufacturers recommend the old tyres be placed in a plastic tyre liner. Make sure it is packed tightly around the tyre. Often, the roof of your car will also need to be removed. However, if it is relatively simple to be removed, we may leave this off for aesthetic reasons.</p>
<h2>Mitsubishi recycling options</h2>
<p>Recycling options for vehicle parts can be found online at the Australian Federal Government&rsquo;s NRMA website. This includes options for disposal and recycling of three different types of Mitsubishi parts &ndash; engine, transmission and clutch. To find more information about how to recycle your <a href="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/autowreckersperth/best-mitsubishi-wrecker.html">old Mitsubishi vehicle</a>, visit www.nrma.gov.au. When should you dispose of your old Mitsubishi vehicle? If you no longer own your vehicle, you may wish to use the disposal or recycling option for it. Most recycling centres are open daily, including long weekends. Once you have found a recycling facility, ensure they accept your vehicle, and have available space to store it. One of the major concerns about recycling your vehicle is its safety for the environment and for workers.</p>
